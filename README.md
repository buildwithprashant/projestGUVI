CareConnect is a web-based Pandemic Response Toolkit designed to help individuals and communities navigate health crises more effectively.

The app brings together four core areas in one place: healthcare resources, such as symptom checking and facility discovery; mental health support, including meditation and crisis resources; a trusted information hub for guidelines and updates; and community connection, where people can offer or request local help.

CareConnect is built as a frontend-only, accessible prototype, focusing on usability for non-technical users, multilingual support, and inclusive design.

Our goal is to demonstrate how a single, simple platform can keep people informed, supported, and connected during a pandemic.

## 🌟 Closing Note
